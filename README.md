# E-Commerce Performance Analysis using SQL

📌 **Project Overview**
This project presents a SQL-based analysis of e-commerce transaction data as part of the **MySkill SQL Final Project**.
The objective is to evaluate sales performance, customer behavior, product categories, and payment methods using **SQL only**, without visualization tools or programming languages such as Python or R.
The dataset simulates e-commerce transactions from **2021–2022** and includes only **valid transactions (`is_valid = 1`)** to ensure accurate analysis.

🎯 **Objectives**
* Identify peak transaction periods and seasonal trends
* Analyze top-performing product categories
* Compare sales performance between 2021 and 2022
* Evaluate category growth and decline
* Analyze customer payment method preferences
* Rank top brands based on transaction value

📊 **Key Metrics Analyzed**
* Total Transaction Value (After Discount)
* Monthly Transaction Trends
* Transaction Value by Product Category
* Year-over-Year Category Performance
* Top Payment Methods by Unique Orders
* Brand Performance by Revenue

🔍 **Key Insights**
* The highest transaction value in 2021 occurred in **August**, driven by increased consumer activity.
* In 2022, **Mobiles & Tablets, Entertainment, and Appliances** became the top revenue-generating categories.
* Most categories experienced growth from 2021 to 2022, indicating post-pandemic recovery.
* **Cash on Delivery (COD)** dominated payment methods, indicating low adoption of digital payments.
* **Samsung** generated the highest transaction value among all brands.

🛠 **Tools Used**
* SQL (MySQL-compatible)
* Dataset: Simulated E-Commerce Transaction Data (MySkill Final Project)

📂 **Project Deliverables**
* SQL query files
* Dataset tables
* PDF analysis report
* Final presentation slides (PDF/PPT)

📝 **Notes**
* This project focuses purely on **SQL-based analysis**.
* No visualization tools or programming languages were used.
* The dataset is simulated and intended for educational and portfolio purposes.
* Analysis includes only valid transactions (`is_valid = 1`).
